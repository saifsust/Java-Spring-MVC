stop tomcat :

First of all check your port : 8080 on your system.

I am using linux , i have followed this approach and it worked for me.

Step 1 : sudo netstat -nlp | grep 8080

It has shown which PID is listening to my port.

tcp6 0 0 :::8080 ::: LISTEN 1112/java*

Step 2 : sudo kill -TERM 1112

And run your project on STS :

Run As -> Run on Server

And it worked fine on http://localhost:8080/myapp/
